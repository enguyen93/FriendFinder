# FriendFinder
# Featuring Express and Node.js
# The Link! https://powerful-beyond-42648.herokuapp.com/

A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. 
Used Express.js to handle the routing. The app is deployed on Heroku. 
This full-stack site takes in results of visitors' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other visitors. 
The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
